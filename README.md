# Encode-Decode
In this project, I used tkinter and base64 libraries to make a GUI app that encodes messages.
When encoding, enter the message, choose a key(any key you want) and press encode.
When decoding, enter the key you entered last time and press decode.
Before encoding/decoding, make sure you type e(for encoding) or d(for decoding)
